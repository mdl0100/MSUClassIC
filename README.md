### Description

Midwestern State Universitys Class Inventory Catlog (MSUClassIC) is a solution to the current method of scheduling academic courses at MSUTexas. 
The goal of this software is to significantly ease the workflow requirements of the following end users:
-  Registrar
-  College Deans
-  Department Chairs

MSUClassIC will allow the above users to view, manage, edit, request, and approve changes to the academic scheduling for upcoming semesters. 
For a valid course to be offered, it must have all of the following information:
1. Course Name
2. Course Time
3. Course Instructor
4. Course Location

A course is unique when all four of these are decided. MSUClassIC must allow for a course to be scheduled without any conflict of the above four points. For example:
- A course instructor cannot be in two locations at the same time, be in two different rooms at the same time, or teach two different classes at the same time (actually is possible, but is a future consideration)
- Two courses cannot share the same room at the same time
