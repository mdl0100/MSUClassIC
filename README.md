### Description

Midwestern State Universitys Class Inventory Catlog (MSUClassIC) is a solution to the current method of scheduling academic courses at MSUTexas. 
The goal of this software is to significantly ease the workflow requirements of the following end users:
-  Registrar
-  College Deans
-  Department Chairs

MSUClassIC will allow the above users to view, manage, edit, request, and approve changes to the academic scheduling for upcoming semesters. 
This is achieved through drag and drop calendar-like scheduling layouts with various views that help our main user roles plan for upcoming semesters.

For a valid course to be offered, it must have all of the following information:
1. Course Name
2. Course Time
3. Course Instructor
4. Course Location

## Example Layout and Functionality
